## What is this bot?
It is a moderation bot. You can use it to moderate your server. It works without errors as of now and should run completely fine. If you have any issues then please open a ticket.
You will need node.js version 16 and this bot uses tools that require that version of node. 

This bot IS in DISCORD.JS V.13

## How do I keep my bot online 24/7.
You will need a hosting. I suggest https://snowsidehosting.com as their an amazing hosting company with fast support. You can also get assistance setting the bot up on their servers
in my Discord. 

## Can you set it up for me? 
No. I don't want to set it up completely for you as if your server gets raided/deleted then you could put me at blame, I don't want to be put to blame for that stuff, so I'll just walk you through it within my Discord.

## Where can I get support?
You can get support via my Discord. You can find my Discord here: https://discord.gg/ksv9GaZJ74
